# Analyzing Image Similarity Using Greyscale Statistical Measures

## Summary
In this project, I analyzed two photos taken at the Suzzallo library at the University of Washington: one with me present and one without. 
To assess their similarity, I utilized statistical measures including Kullback–Leibler divergence, Jensen–Shannon divergence, 
and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (KS test). These methods compare the greyscale distributions of the images. The primary difference in the
photos is my presence, occupying roughly 10% of the frame. The results from the statistical measures highlight a strong similarity between the two images, consistent with the observations.


## Setup
This project is developed using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. Refer to `photos_compare.ipynb` for the required packages.


## File Descriptions
- `photos_compare.ipynb`: Python notebook for the greyscale analysis of two photos.
- `photos_compare.pdf`: The PDF format of the main script.
- `withme.png`: A photo of me sitting in Suzzallo library at University of Washington.
- `withoutme.png`: Another photo taken at the same place without me.


## Content
This project includes 3 parts, specifically: 
1. Import and display the two photos.
2. Plot the greyscale histograms of both photos.
3. Employ three statistical tools to quantify the similarities between the greyscale distributions of the two photos.
